# 2  It uses progressive Javascript , is built with and fully supports typeScript 

# 3 It combines elements of OOP (object oriented programming) , FP ( functional programming) , and FRP(Functional Reactive Programming)

# 4 Under the hood , Nest js makes use of robust HTTP Server frameworks like Express(the default) and optionally can be configured to use Fastify as well !
     -we need nest js because express js never tells you how to organize your're app
     -when the app becomes bigger , organization becomes difficult .... 
     -All packages that express uses can be used in nest js
